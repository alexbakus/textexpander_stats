textexpander_stats
==================

Export Textexpander snippets and count per snippet into a tab delimited text file. 

Can be used as proxy of most common issues dealt with.

Written in Apple Script, can be compiled into an app.

Saves 2 files, Master_List.txt, and a username.txt in Data folder, as back up of all Snippets + count info.

Must download and save snippet. Must have Data Folder for second file.

Quick and Dirty :-)


Usage:

Works with Texexpander > 3.2.4, this version does not have count in it's library.

Anything above should work fine. 

Download the .scpt file, Save your local copy, in the same folder as the script, create

a folder called Data.

Run with AppleScript Editor.
